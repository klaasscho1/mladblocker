# Machine Learning AdBlocker
**By Klaas Schoenmaker and Marjolijn Stam**

This program uses over 100.000 links crawled from the top-500 most-visited websites. After being trained with AdBlock Plus's EasyList, our model is able to predict whether a link is an ad-related link or not with 95% accuracy.
